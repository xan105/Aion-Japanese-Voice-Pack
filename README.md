> Change the voice acting of your Aion client into sweet Japanese or Korean.

ðŸ’¡ If you are just looking for the Aion Japanese / Korean voice pack go to the [release section](https://github.com/xan105/Aion-Japanese-Voice-Pack/releases).

ðŸ˜Ž If you want to fetch the latest audio files directly from the Japanese / Korean update server then continue reading.

<hr> 

This is a Node.js script _inspired by / copied from_ my previous work with my alternative [Aion Launcher](https://github.com/xan105/Aion-Launcher) to fetch audio files directly from the game update server.

You will need Node.js (â‰¥ 14) and NPM installed : https://nodejs.org/en/

Get the script
==============

To get everything and its dependencies :

```
git clone https://github.com/xan105/Aion-Japanese-Voice-Pack
cd Aion-Japanese-Voice-Pack
npm i
```

Configure
=========

Modify `option.json` to suit your needs :

- cc : Japanese is `4`, Korean is `0` (default to 4). Region info are in `aion/cc.js`
- dest : `"path/where/to/create/voicepack"` (default to "./voicepack/[_realm.locale_]" if omitted)
- prefix: "a-z" Use `"z"` to prefix every files with the letter z so you can use the files with official launcher, etc (file check bypass). If omitted doesn't add any prefix (default).
- patch : true/false (default true) Recommended to use `true` so the voice order matches Aion NA/EU. (Only for Japanese Pack)

NB: `%temp%\Aion Voice Pack` is used as temporary folder (downloading, extracting, patching). 
If you want to change that edit both `aion/voicepack.js` and `aion/aion.js`
There is a `const TEMP = ...` in the top of the file.

### Some examples:

- Download and update Japanese Pack directly to your Aion folder

`{"cc": 4, dest: "C:\\Game\\Aion\L10N\\ENU\\Sounds",prefix: "z", patch: true }`

- Download raw Japanese Pack in the folder "voicepack"

`{"cc": 4, dest: "./voicepack", patch: false }`

- Download Korean Pack in Aion EU (FRA) folder

`{"cc": 0, dest: "G:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Aion\\client\\L10N\\FRA\\Sounds",prefix: "z" }`

- Download English NA Pack in the folder "voicepack/na"

`{"cc": 1}`

Run
===

`node main.js`

NB: You can also use it to update an existing voice pack : file that already exists and have the same hash are skipped from any download.
